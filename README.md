# Donna OS

**A manager-and-employees layer for Claude Code — one agent (Donna) that routes your request to a team of specialist agents, runs them in parallel, verifies their work, and hands you back a single answer.**

Most AI coding setups are one assistant doing everything. Real teams don't work that way — they have a manager who knows *who* to ask, specialists who go deep, and someone who double-checks the work before it ships. Donna OS is that structure, expressed as [Claude Code subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents).

You talk to **Donna**. Donna decides which **specialists** the question needs, dispatches them (in parallel when she can), and **synthesizes one coherent answer** — after a **verifier** has checked their claims for confabulation. You can add your own specialists by dropping in a file, and shape each one's behavior by editing a template.

> ⚠️ **This is an opinionated starting point, not a finished product.** It ships the *interactive* framework — the part that works the moment you open Claude Code in this folder. The optional always-on/autonomous mode (a background watcher + web dashboard) is on the [roadmap](#roadmap), not in this repo yet.

```

**The loop:** `decide who → dispatch specialists (parallel) → verify → synthesize`. Donna runs it every time, in one or several rounds until she can answer with confidence.

---

> 📐 **Want the full picture?** The [**Architecture deep-dive**](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) covers the runtime loop, the anti-confabulation verification layer, the end-to-end observability model, and the reliability engineering (crash recovery, process-tree kills, budget caps, atomic job-claiming).

## The team (18 agents)

**Donna** — the manager. The only agent that can dispatch others; routes, orchestrates, and synthesizes.

**The specialists:**

| Engineering | Product & research | Ops & quality |
|---|---|---|
| `senior-engineer` — code review | `decision-analyzer` — decision briefs | `qa-lead` — does it actually work? |
| `architect` — drift/design | `researcher` — cited web research | `verifier` — anti-confabulation |
| `debugger` — root-cause (no fix w/o RCA) | `customer-signal-synth` — feedback→patterns | `cso` — security audit |
| `data-engineer` — DB integrity (read-only) | `content-evaluator` — content quality | `performance-engineer` — web vitals |
| `doc-syncer` — docs-vs-code drift | `progress-tracker` — activity data | `cost-watcher` — spend tracking |
| | | `morning-briefer` / `eod-digester` — daily briefs |

Each specialist is a self-contained `.claude/agents/*.md` file (its role, tools, and behavior) with its own append-only memory log.

---

## Quick start (works in ~30 seconds)

1. **Copy the framework into your project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<you>/donna-os.git
   cp -r donna-os/.claude/agents /your/project/.claude/agents
   ```
2. **Open your project in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).**
3. **Ask Donna something that needs more than one specialist**, e.g.:
   > *"Donna, review the auth changes on this branch and tell me if they're safe to ship."*

   Watch her route it to `senior-engineer` + `cso` + `qa-lead`, run them, verify, and hand back one synthesized answer.

*(Optional: fill in the templates under `.claude/agents/context/` to give the team your product/team context, and they'll tailor every answer to your project.)*

---

## Extend it

- **Add a specialist** → drop a new `.claude/agents/<name>.md` (frontmatter + a role prompt). Add its name to Donna's roster in `donna.md` so she'll dispatch it.
- **Refine a specialist** → edit its `.md` template. That's the whole "tuning" surface.
- **Give the team context** → fill in the `context/` templates once.

## What this is / isn't

| It **is** | It **isn't** |
|---|---|
| A drop-in multi-agent framework for Claude Code | A hosted product or a chatbot |
| Interactive, works immediately | An always-on autonomous system (see roadmap) |
| Fully editable — every behavior is a template | A black box |
| Anti-confabulation by design (the verifier) | Guaranteed correct — it reduces, not eliminates, error |
| **Read-only & safe** — it observes and reports | An autonomous code-editor (write access is a deliberately gated roadmap item) |

## Skills & credits

Several specialists reach for **skills** — reusable procedures that live *outside* this repo and are installed globally in Claude Code. Donna OS **references** them by name; it does **not** bundle anyone else's code.

- **gstack** — a third-party Claude Code skill pack, and the one Donna's team leans on most. `senior-engineer`, `qa-lead`, `cso`, `debugger`, `verifier`, and `performance-engineer` reach for gstack skills such as `/review`, `/qa`, `/cso`, `/investigate`, `/benchmark`, and `/canary`. **Install gstack for the specialists to reach full capability.** *(Add your install link here.)*
- **Official Anthropic skills** — a few agents use skills like `code-review`, `security-review`, and `document-generate` / `document-release`.

**Without those packs installed, the affected specialists still run — they fall back to their own built-in reasoning** (a graceful degrade, not a crash). Donna's routing, the verify-then-synthesize loop, and every role's core judgment work with **zero external skills**.

> Think of it this way: the `.md` files here are the **team and their playbooks**. The external skill packs are the **power tools** they pick up — installed separately, like any developer's toolchain.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Autonomous mode — a background watcher that runs Donna headlessly on a queue
- [ ] Web dashboard for sessions, specialist calls, and memory
- [ ] Cross-project shared memory
- [ ] A specialist marketplace / starter packs
